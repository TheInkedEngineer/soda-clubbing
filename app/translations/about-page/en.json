  "pageContent": "The music is **cardio**\nThe energy is **high**.\nSODA is an **explicit party**.\n\nIt is a tool for self-discovery in Milan's nightlife, a space where you can caress your own limits, taste them, and grow.\n\nThe party aims to provide a home for those who do not judge and do not want to be judged, for those who want to feel free to experiment, observe, and challenge themselves.\nFeeling bold and sexual is allowed, but having sex is not the goal. This means that sex is on the table, but it's not the main course. The open, free, excited community is the appetizer, the main course, and even the dessert.\n\n**Come conscious and turned on, dressed to impress.Greet old friends, make new ones, flirt, and dance until morning.**\n\nWe need to find ourselves again, to party and feel the euphoria of warm bodies around us. Individual participants shine with their own light, but also feed off the collective energy: SODA is a magical experience only if those who participate are a harmonious part of it."
