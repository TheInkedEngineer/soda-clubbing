SODA Angels take care of the well-being of everyone present, ready to intervene in case of emergencies and to ensure compliance with the rules, such as consent and privacy.\n\nDuring the event, Angels move around the venue and are available to offer emotional support and useful information, especially for those attending the party for the first time.\n\n**Their presence ensures that everyone can have fun in a safe and respectful environment.**"
